4. Click the **Try it out** button on the right
5. Click the blue Execute button. You may see that the Response Body has an empty array of data as we have not yet created any physicians.

7. Click the **Try it out** button on the right
8. Edit the example text and provide a name (eg Fred Smith) and speciality (eg General Practitioner) for your physician  
9. Click the blue Execute button and note that the physician should have been added.
