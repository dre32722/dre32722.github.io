## Adding H2 as an in-memory database

For the development environment, we will use an in-memory database. The benefit of this is that each developer can run this of their own workstation/laptop without a large dev infrastructure. We'll be using [H2](http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) as the in-memory database.

### Add H2 to the maven dev profile

1. Open the pom.xml
2. Add the following dependency under the dev profile:

```xml
<dependency>
<groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
<artifactId>h2</artifactId>
<scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Configure the application to use the database

3. Open the application.properties (or application.yaml) and the following:

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=liquibase
spring.datasource.password=
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:liquibase

4. Run the application:
```bash
mvn -Pdev spring-boot:run
```

5. Access the H2 web console: [http://localhost:8080/h2-console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console)
