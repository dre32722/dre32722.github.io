## Setting up a basic Springboot project

1. Launch Netbeans
2. Create a new project:
    1. File > New Project
    2. Maven > Spring boot basic project
    3. Give your project a name

> **N.B.** Alternatively, you can use the Springboot Initializer option under Maven and pick your dependencies. We'll add them gradually.
