## Implement other controllers

### Create Controllers for other entities
1. Create a REST Controller for Patients, Physicians, Prescriptions
2. Create GET methods for each controller as in AdminController
3. Create an additional GET method that allows us to search for prescriptions with number of refills remaining
4. Create POST, PUT, DELETE for all other controllers
