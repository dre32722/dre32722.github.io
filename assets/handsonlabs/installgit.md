## Installation on Ubuntu 16.04

This section will help you deploy the git client software as a pre-cursor to installations of Node.js, MongoDB and Python.

The first step is to ensure that you have installed Git in your environment. 
Validate the installation of the required components (one at a time):
<br>
git --version
<br>
Assuming Git is not installed then execute the following command.
<br>
sudo apt-get install git -y
<br>

Validate your Git installation:
<br>
git --version
<br>

The above command should return a valid version. 
I used Git version 2.7.4 while building this application.
