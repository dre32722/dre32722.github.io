### Git Install

This section will help you deploy the git client software into your environment. 

### Installation on Ubuntu 16.04

The following instructions are what I use don Ubuntu 16.04 but if in doubt refer the All Platforms link below.

Verify your installation by executing the following command:

``` git --version ```

Assuming Git is not installed then execute the following command.

``` sudo apt-get install git -y ```

Validate your Git installation:

``` git --version ```

The above command should return a valid version.
