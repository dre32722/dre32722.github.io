### Install Docker.

This section will help you deploy the docker software that can be optionally used to run the MedRec applciations.

### 1.1 Install Docker (if not already installed)

To find your platform specific install instructions at [docker.com](https://www.docker.com).

To verify your Docker installation:

*sudo docker --version*

You should get a valid version. My install was Docker version 17.06.0-ce, build 02c1d87.
