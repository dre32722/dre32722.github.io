### Fork the MedRec Python Git Repository 

This section contains instructions to fork the repository that contains some sample python code.
The python code provides a different client to the SwaggerUI that will interact with the same APIs.

Follow the same steps as you used to fork the medrecapi project.
- Point your browser to GitHub
- Login to GitHub using your credentials
- Search for barackd222/ankimedrec-python.git repository
- Fork the repository
- Navigate to view your forked copy of the repository
- Click Clone or Download
- Copy the URL for the repository

On your laptop change directory into your *myprojects directory* (or whatever you used).
Next execute the following command;

*git clone https://yourusername/ankimedrec-python.git*
