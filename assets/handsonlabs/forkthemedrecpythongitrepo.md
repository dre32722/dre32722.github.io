### Fork the MedRec Python Git Repository 

This section contains instructions to fork the repository that contains some sample python code.
The python code provides a different client to the SwaggerUI that will interact with the same APIs.

Follow the same steps as you used to fork the medrecapi project.
- Point your browser to GitHub
- Login to GitHub using your credentials
- Search for **barackd222/ankimedrec-python** repository
- Fork the repository
- Navigate to view your forked copy of the repository
- Click Clone or Download
- Copy the URL for the repository

Now, on your laptop change directory into your *myprojects directory* (or whatever you want to clone this new python code repository). 

Next execute the following command:

**git clone [GIT_HTTPS_REPO_LOCATION]**

Move into this directory and look around its content.
