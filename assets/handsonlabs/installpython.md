### Install Python on Ubuntu 16.04

Ubuntu 16.04 ships with both Python 3 and Python 2 pre-installed, however the steps details in Step 1 of the following document may help you upgrade etc.
I used python 3.5.2 on my Ubuntu 16.04 operating system but instructions below will shopw to install a later version which also works fine. 

-	If using Ubuntu 16.04, you have to add python to the universe repository: 
``` 
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6 ```
-	Then, simple run:
```
sudo apt-get update 
```
```
sudo 
apt-get install python3.6 -y 
```

Then confirm the installation by typing:
```python3.6 --version ```

It should bring something like: Python 3.6.1+
