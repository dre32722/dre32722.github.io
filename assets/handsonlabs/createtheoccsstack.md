### Create the OCCS Stack definition and deploy the container

As an alternative to running the APIs locally we may decide to deploy into the Oracle Public Cloud.
The Oracle Container Cloud Service (OCCS) provides a runtime environment for your Docker containers (essentiually Bring Yopur Own Container)

This assumes the user has access to the Oracle Container Cloud Service and involves the following;
- login to OCCS 
- create stack in OCCS using yml file
- deploy the stack
- access the apis - url
