### Installation of Docker-Compose

This section provides instructions to install docker-compose.
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

Docker for Mac, Docker for Windows, and Docker Toolbox include Docker Compose, so most Mac and Windows users do not need to install Docker Compose separately.

In our case we will have a container for the MedRec Node.js web application and another container for the MongoDB database.
