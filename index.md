**Anki-MedRec Platform**
===================


MedRec NG is essentially an experimental platform with some basic elements at its core such as:
 
-	a System of Record (Avitek â€“ MedRec) to act as a discussion point around Systems of Record, and the need to differentiate and innovate outside of the Systems of Record.
- a re-developed version of the MedRec demo application based on a Microservices based approach to deliver learnings around developing Cloud Native Applications and DevOps.
-	basic CRUD APIs against MedRec NG to provide a starting point upon which participants can bring their innovative ideas to explore and prove.
- a modern User Interface leveraging the new microservices-based APIsto demonstrate what is required and possible when improving customer experience.


MedRec NG will serve as a vehicle to overlay innovative ideas and implement them using various Cloud Services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and Open Source software. We hope
it will encourage learning and innovation from a number of perspectives whether you are running a workshop, running a conference, a hackathon or just self-learning around the following areas:

- Polyglot Development (Java, JavaScript, Python, Node.js etc)
- APIs
- Integration
- Security
- Containers
- Source Code Management and Control (GitHub)
- Operating System (Linux)
- Mobility, Chatbots, Robotics
