**Anki-MedRec Platform**
===================


The MedRec Platform is essentially a playpen with some basic elements at its core such as,
 
-	a rudimentary System of Record (Avitek – MedRec) to act as a discussion point around Systems of Record, and the need to differentiate and innovate outside of the Systems of Record.
- a re-developed next generation version of MedRec based on a MicroServices based approach (MedRec NG) to deliver learnings around API development and DevOps.
- a modern User Interface rolled on top of the API's developed for MedRec NG to demonstrate what is possible re improved customer experience.
-	Java based internal APIs that support CRUD operations against MedRec NG to provide a starting point upon which participants can bring their innovative ideas to explore and prove.

With the core application and internal API’s locked down as Version 1, the MedRec Platform Playpen will then serve as a vehicle to overlay innovative ideas and implement them using various Cloud Services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and Open Source software to demonstrate proof points around the ideas. 

It is hoped that this platform will encourage fun, learning and innovation from a number of perspectives whether you are running a workshop, running a conference, or a hackathon or just self-learning around the following areas;
- Ployglot Development (JEE, JavaScript, Python, Node,js etc)
- API's
- Integration
- Security
- Containers, Registries
- Source Code Management and Control (GitHub)
- Operating System (Linux)
- Mobility, Chatbots, Robotics
